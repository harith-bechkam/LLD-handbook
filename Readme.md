# SOLID Principles vs Design Patterns

## SOLID Principles

- **Reusable**
- **Maintainable**
- **Readable** - Other developers can easily read and develop.

### What are SOLID Principles?
- It is a set of 5 principles that guide how to write **clean**, **maintainable**, and **scalable** object-oriented code.

## Design Pattern

- A **design pattern** is a **reusable solution** to a common software design problem.
- Think of it as a **blueprint** â€” not exact code, but a **proven structure** or technique.
- **First**, set up the project using design patterns, and then only your application logic goes in.

## Examples of Design Patterns (from GoF - "Gang of Four"):

| Type        | Pattern                        | Example Use                        |
|-------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Creational** | Singleton, Factory, Builder   | Object creation                    |
| **Structural** | Adapter, Decorator, Composite | Class structure and relationships |
| **Behavioral** | Observer, Strategy, Command   | Communication between objects      |

## Summary:

| Concept          | Type              | Purpose                        |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| **SOLID**        | Principles        | How to design (rules)         |
| **Design Patterns** | Reusable solutions | What to design (templates)    |

By using **SOLID principles** and **design patterns**, you can **build clean**, **maintainable**, and **scalable applications**.
