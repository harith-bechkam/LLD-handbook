# SOLID-Principles

# S - single responsibility principle
# O - Open/closed principle
# L - Liskov substitution principle
# I - interface segregation principle
# D - Dependency Inversion

# S
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

# O
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This allows adding new functionality without altering existing code.
In simpler terms:
You should be able to add new behavior without changing existing code.
This helps avoid bugs in working code and supports scalability.
